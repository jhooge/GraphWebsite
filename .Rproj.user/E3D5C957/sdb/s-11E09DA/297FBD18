It plots significance versus fold-change on the y and x axes, respectively. These plots are increasingly common in omic experiments such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics where one often has a list of many thousands of replicate data points between two conditions and one wishes to quickly identify the most meaningful changes. A volcano plot combines a measure of statistical significance from a statistical test (e.g., a p value from an ANOVA model) with the magnitude of the change, enabling quick visual identification of those data-points (genes, etc.) that display large magnitude changes that are also statistically significant.\n\n```{r volcano_plot, tidy=FALSE}\nlibrary(BioViz)\ndata(iPSC)\ngeneral.volcano_plot(iPSC, title = \"Volcano Plot\", groups = c(\"Untreated\",\n  \"Treated\"), top_labeled = 0, xlabel = expression(log[2](\"Foldchange\")),\n  ylabel = expression(-log[10](\"p-value\")), xcutoff = c(-log2(4), log2(4)),\n  ycutoff = -log10(0.05), log1p = FALSE)\n```\n",
